# 🔒 Information Leakage Prevention Through AI Enabled Pattern Matching Algorithm On Social Media 


## 🎯 Motto of Our Project  
<p align="center">
  <b>SPEAK FREELY, STAY PROTECTED</b>  
</p>

## 🚀 Why This Matters  
Traditional keyword-based detection often leads to **false alarms**.  
Our approach combines **AI + Pattern Matching** to ensure users can:  

✅ Communicate freely  
✅ Stay safe from hidden information leaks  
✅ Trust the system to filter **real threats**

## 📌 Project Overview
As a **Project Intern** at *Birla Institute of Technology*, I developed an **Pattern Matching System** designed to detect **Vulnerable and context-sensitive terms** (e.g., blood relations) that often appear in cyber threat communications.  

The system combines **classical pattern matching** with **Machine Learning** to improve detection accuracy while significantly reducing false positives.

## ⚡ Key Contributions
- 🛠 **Engineered** a robust pattern matching model tailored for cyber security applications, capable of identifying context-sensitive terms like *blood relations*.  
- 🤖 **Trained a Logistic Regression Classifier** on a carefully labeled dataset of *vulnerable* vs *non-vulnerable* terms.  
- 🎯 **Minimized false positives** by integrating contextual similarity checks, improving the system’s trustworthiness.  
- 🔍 **Leveraged ML techniques** to determine whether a new word is *contextually similar* to existing vulnerable terms stored in the dataset.  
- 📈 **Achieved 95.86% Accuracy** and **96.34% Precision**, ensuring highly reliable detection of cyber threats.

## 🚀 Impact
This hybrid approach of **pattern matching + ML-based contextual detection** provides a **scalable and reliable solution** for enhancing cyber threat detection systems.  

By reducing false alarms and improving precision, the model ensures that security analysts can focus on **real threats** without being overwhelmed by noise.
